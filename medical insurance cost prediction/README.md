# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 🚀  

This project is part of **CodePeak 2025** and focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to analyze medical insurance data and build a predictive model to estimate insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset used for this analysis is **insurance.csv**.  
- It contains features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and insurance charges.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, RandomForest  
  - **Feature Engineering**: Ordinal Encoding, Label Encoding, Mutual Information  
  - **Data Balancing**: SMOTE  

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Feature correlations and distributions  
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly  

## 🏗️ Model Building  
- **Random Forest Regression**  
- **XGBoost Regression**  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
